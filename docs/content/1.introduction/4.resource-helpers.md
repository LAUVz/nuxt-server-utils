# Resource Helpers

The resource helpers are a set of functions that are used to abstract away the details of working with the database. They are used internally by the `defineEventHandler` function to implement the `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, and `destroy` methods.

## Index

The `ResourceHelper.index` method is used to implement the `index` method. It returns a function that accepts an event object and returns a promise that resolves to an array of resources.

```ts [server/api/users.get.ts]
import { ResourceHelper } from "#nuxt-server-utils";
import { User } from "~~/server/models/User.model";

export default defineEventHandler(
  ResourceHelper.index({
    model: User,
  })
);
```

The `ResourceHelper.index` method accepts an options object with the following properties:

- `model` - The Mongoose model to use for querying the database.
- `related` - An array of related models to populate.
- `beforeFnHook` - A function that is called before the query is executed.
- `afterFnHook` - A function that is called after the query is executed.

## Show

The `ResourceHelper.show` method is used to implement the `show` method. It returns a function that accepts an event object and returns a promise that resolves to a single resource.

```ts [server/api/users/[id].get.ts]
import { ResourceHelper } from "#nuxt-server-utils";
import { User } from "~~/server/models/User.model";

export default defineEventHandler(
  ResourceHelper.show({
    model: User,
  })
);
```

The `ResourceHelper.show` method accepts an options object with the following properties:

- `model` - The Mongoose model to use for querying the database.
- `related` - An array of related models to populate.
- `beforeFnHook` - A function that is called before the query is executed.
- `afterFnHook` - A function that is called after the query is executed.

## Destroy

The `ResourceHelper.destroy` method is used to implement the `delete` method. It returns a function that accepts an event object and returns a promise that resolves to a single resource.

```ts [server/api/users/[id].delete.ts]
import { ResourceHelper } from "#nuxt-server-utils";
import { User } from "~~/server/models/User.model";

export default defineEventHandler(
  ResourceHelper.destroy({
    model: User,
  })
);
```

The `ResourceHelper.destroy` method accepts an options object with the following properties:

- `model` - The Mongoose model to use for querying the database.
- `intigrity` - An array of related models to which the resource must not be related.
- `checkSelf` - A boolean indicating whether the resource must not be related to itself.
- `afterFnHook` - A function that is called after the query is executed.
